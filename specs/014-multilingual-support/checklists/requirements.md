# Specification Quality Checklist: Multilingual Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- 7 assumptions documented (A-001 through A-007) covering flag representation, per-device vs per-player preference, ordinals, brand name, RTL scope, date formatting, and avatar text translation.
- 6 edge cases identified covering multi-language browser preferences, localStorage unavailability, missing dictionary keys, long text, mixed-script names, and templated messages with names.
